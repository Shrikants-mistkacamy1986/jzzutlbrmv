Dude, I'm still feeling like I’m kinda bobbing in a sea of… I dunno, action or something. Just walked outta iHostage, right, and wow. Okay, so like, imagine if your brain was a jigsaw puzzle and someone just chucked all the pieces in the air — that’s what it feels like right now. My back is stiff from those theater seats; it’s like sitting on lumpy clouds—or maybe cloud-shaped rocks?? And popcorn crumbs are somehow sticking to my shirt like they got magnets in them or smth. 

This  . MAN. It’s nuts. They had this scene with the main dude, Shawn or Sam or whatever, rushing through this blown-out building. Reminded me of that time you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed that app that tracks mice in your walls (weird, ikr), but with BULLETS. And that plot twist… was like when you THINK you’ve lost a sock in the laundry cycle, but then BOOM — it’s in your pillowcase? Maybe not that exactly, I dunno what I’m saying. 

> Also at one point, I genuinely thought my phone vibrated, but it was just the bass rumbling through like angry elephants doing a conga line. So many people around me were coughing like it was a symphony of sneezes. URGH, germs. Anyway 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   when you can, def worth it even if just for the wild helicopter pirouette-scene, wtf was that.

Remember how someone was asking us if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? I’d say yes, but get ready for a full-brain workout. Oh, and side note — popcorn somehow tastes better when you're wearing a jacket. Don't ask why, maybe because it’s like a portable napkin.

One point this lady, I guess, she was screaming louder than I do when I look at my IRL electric bill. I mean, relate much? Then, I lost track of whether I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   or dreaming with my eyes open. 

Anyway, uh, think that’s all I got right now. Just saw a helicopter explode on screen and I can still see it when I blink. Why they gotta do helicopters like that?

Here I accidentally dropped some code sorry: 
```csharp
void NothingMakesSense() {
    var chaos = new Confusion();
    while(sanity) {
        doNothing();
    }
}
```
